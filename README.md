This project was highly inspired by [resmon](https://github.com/Njanderson/resmon), using its main concept for watching of resource usage.

Resource monitoring is entirely done using [systeminformation](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation).

## Features

Shows stats of certain resources of the system in the VSCode statusbar.

![Example](images/example.png)

Currently supported features:
- Battery Percentage (if available)
- CPU Frequency
  - Windows: will report the maximum CPU frequency.
  - M1 Mac: will report the maximum CPU frequency.
- CPU Temperature (with certain limits)
  - Windows: some CPUs might not be supported properly. Also, it might not work if not run with admin privileges. See [Known Issue of systeminformation](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation#windows-temperature-battery-)
  - Mac: does not work on Mac. See [Known Issue of systeminformation](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation#macos---temperature-sensor)
  - Linux: [Known Issue of systeminformation](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation#linux-temperature)
- CPU Usage
- Disk Stats
- Memory Usage
- Network Stats (received and transferred byte/seconds)
- Swap Usage
- Uptime


> Note: Newest hardware such as Apple's M2 or other newer Intel, AMD CPUs might not be supported right away. This extension heavily relies on [systeminformation](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation)

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `resourceWatchdog.battery.show`: Shows CPU usage
* `resourceWatchdog.cpuFrequency.show`: Shows current CPU frequency. On Windows & M1 Mac, it will show the maximum CPU frequency.
* `resourceWatchdog.cpuFrequency.unit`: Unit of CPU frequency. Options are: `GHz`, `MHz`, `KHz` or `Hz`.
* `resourceWatchdog.cpuTemperature.show`: Shows current CPU temperature. Check known issues for more information.
* `resourceWatchdog.cpuTemperature.unit`: Unit of CPU temperature. Options are: `C` or `F`.
* `resourceWatchdog.cpuUsage.show`: Shows current CPU usage.
* `resourceWatchdog.disk.show`: Shows disk usage of added disks.
* `resourceWatchdog.disk.format`: Format of disk usage. Options are: `PercentRemaining`, `PercentUsed`, `Remaining` or `UsedOutOfTotal`.
* `resourceWatchdog.disk.drives`: Disks to show. If empty, no disks will be shown.
* `resourceWatchdog.memory.show`: Shows memory usage.
* `resourceWatchdog.memory.unit`: Unit of memory usage. Options are: `GB`, `MB`, `KB` or `B`.
* `resourceWatchdog.memory.dangerThreshold`: Threshold for memory usage. If memory usage is above this threshold, the extension will add a warning icon after the value.
* `resourceWatchdog.networkIn.show`: Shows received bytes/second of all network interfaces.
* `resourceWatchdog.networkOut.show`: Shows transferred bytes/second of all network interfaces.
* `resourceWatchdog.swap.show`: Shows swap usage.
* `resourceWatchdog.swap.unit`: Unit of swap usage. Options are: `GB`, `MB`, `KB` or `B`.
* `resourceWatchdog.swap.dangerThreshold`: Threshold for swap usage. If swap usage is above this threshold, the extension will add a warning icon after the value.
* `resourceWatchdog.uptime.show`: Shows uptime.
* `resourceWatchdog.colorOverride`: Color override of the status bar text (hex code). If empty (default), the extension will use the theme color.
* `resourceWatchdog.leftAlignment`: If true, the status bar text will be left aligned, otherwise it will be right aligned.
* `resourceWatchdog.precision`: Number of decimal places to show. Options is: 0 â‰¤ precision â‰¤ 4.
* `resourceWatchdog.updateFrequencyMs`: Update frequency in milliseconds. You might want to increase this if you see a lot of CPU usage to reduce update interval.

## Known Issues

Known Issues are already mentioned for each feature.

## Release Notes

## [1.3.0]
- TypeScript 5.0 upgrade
- Bump dependencies

## [1.2.0]
- Disables "Show battery" by default
- Improve performance of battery status updates if "Show battery" is enabled by caching if battery is available ([#2](https://github.com/alexkainzinger/resource-watchdog/issues/2))
- Bump dependencies

## [1.1.1]
- Slight performance improvements by checking if certain stats are enabled before deciding if it can be shown (by requesting it from the system), e.g. Battery, CPU Temperature & Disk
- Bump dependencies, notable: `systeminformation` to resolve typing issue

## [1.1.0]
- Renamed `resourceWatchdog.color` to `resourceWatchdog.colorOverride` to better support light themes ([#1](https://github.com/alexkainzinger/resource-watchdog/issues/1))
- Improve galleryBanner color for VSCode Marketplace

## [1.0.0] - Initial Version ðŸŽ‰

- Support for:
  - Battery Percentage
  - CPU Frequency (with certain limits)
  - CPU Temperature (with certain limits)
  - CPU Usage
  - Disk Stats
  - Memory Usage
  - Network Stats (received and transferred byte/seconds)
  - Swap Usage
  - Uptime
